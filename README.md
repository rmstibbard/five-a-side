# Five-a-Side Footy Fun

## Final Technical Challenge for DevelopMe_ Coding Fellowship

The brief was to create a tool which randomly picks 5-a-side football teams from a list of 10 names.

A working version can be seen online on Github Pages at [https://rmstibbard.github.io/five-a-side](https://rmstibbard.github.io/five-a-side).


## Setup

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

## Prerequisites

You will need to have NPM installed in order to set the application up.

## Installation

### Clone the git repository and run NPM install:
- `git clone https://github.com/rmstibbard/five-a-side`
- Change directory (`cd`) into the five-a-side directory.
- Install the necessary packages by running: `npm install`
- When all the packages have been installed, start the app by running: `npm start`
- Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

## Planning
A mobile-first approach was taken to the design of the layout. Wireframes for the responsive design were created before developing the app.
